		<div id="mainpara">The concept of somatotypes was introduced in the 1940's by William H. Sheldon. It is used by a number of professionals ranging from nutritionists to doctors to help create efficient personal fitness routines. Each person more or less falls into one of the three categories: Ectomorph, Mesomorph, and Endomorph. Each category has it's defining features, however, it is not uncommon for an individual to have traits of multiple categories such as Ecto/Meso or Endo/Meso. Somatotypes play a huge role in how you respond to diet and training so understanding them is important!</div>

They are genetically blessed to be lean and tone year-round with little to no effort. They have a high metabolism that aids in staying lean, in fact, it's possibly the biggest reason for such. They are considered delicate because they are thin and have little fat and muscle. Typically, they have thin faces, narrow shoulders, and are very bony. Ectomorphs must work extremely hard to gain even small amounts of muscle and work even harder to maintain it.</p>

			<h3> My Bodybuilding History</h3>
			<p>I've been into bodybuilding for 5 years. Only within the last two have I both taken it seriously and become a personal trainer. My oldest brother got me into bodybuilding in the first place. He has been a trainer for 20+ years and was the runner-up in the 2009 Mr. Indiana competition. I have extensive knowledge in lifting techniques and nutrition, as well as multiple clients that have reached great achievements in their journey of transforming their body.</p>
