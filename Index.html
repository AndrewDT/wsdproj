		<div id="mainpara">The concept of somatotypes was introduced in the 1940's by William H. Sheldon. It is used by a number of professionals ranging from nutritionists to doctors to help create efficient personal fitness routines. Each person more or less falls into one of the three categories: Ectomorph, Mesomorph, and Endomorph. Each category has it's defining features, however, it is not uncommon for an individual to have traits of multiple categories such as Ecto/Meso or Endo/Meso. Somatotypes play a huge role in how you respond to diet and training so understanding them is important!</div>

			<p id="ectop">Extreme ectomorphs are those types you see that although they may or may not work out, have a 6-pack. They are genetically blessed to be lean and tone year-round with little to no effort. They have a high metabolism that aids in staying lean, in fact, it's possibly the biggest reason for such. They are considered delicate because they are thin and have little fat and muscle. Typically, they have thin faces, narrow shoulders, and are very bony. Ectomorphs must work extremely hard to gain even small amounts of muscle and work even harder to maintain it. They have lighter bone structure in comparison to the other somatotypes and a bigger part of their body structure is made up of the nervous system which causes them to be more emotionally sensitive. In terms of strength, ectomorphs are not genetically blessed and in addition to size, have a difficult time increasing overall strength. That said, ectomorphs are capable of being very proficient in body weight exercises and can come to maintain top-level strict form in such. Due to their lack of muscle and fat, ectomorphs are also prone to suffering worse from colder temperatures. Other features typical of an extreme ectomorph would be sensitivity to the sun,long fingers, arms, legs, and torso. A high carb diet would be the best approach in gaining mass in conjunction with heavy weight training, no cardio, and a mass gaining protein supplement. With some hard work and determination, ectomorphs are very capable of reaching their fitness goals. </p>

			<p id="mesop">Mesomorphs are the type of person you see that look as though they work out regularly and train hard, however, they may not work out at all. They are genetically blessed to have the composition and appearance of an athlete without necessarily doing hardly, if any, work. Mesomorphs have large muscle and little fat. They are the most capable of putting on lean muscle and gaining strength simultaneously. Mesomorphs have large, broad shoulders and a wide back that gives them a V-shape down to their waist. Bones and muscle are prominent in the body and a mesomorph somatotype is ideal for any serious bodybuilder. Mesomorphs have a balanced body, which means that their composition of muscle, bones, and the nervous system are balanced throughout. Due to their balanced nervous system, mesomorphs are highly tolerant, especially in comparison to the emotional state of an ectomorph. Mesomorphs are usually highly energetic and can easily handle multiple sports and forms of physical activities naturally. Features are typically a very "manly" face and jaw and tanning with ease. There are combination ectomorphs that take on traits from either the ectomorph or endomorph somatotypes. In this case, mesomorphs may be prone to minor difficulties in body growth because of the negatives of another somatotype.</p>

	<section id="sectionendo">
			<p id="endop">Extreme Endomorphs are the type of person you see that has a high body fat percentage, but can lift heavy weight naturally. They typically have under-developed muscles that are soft and covered by their large amount of body fat, to put it simply they have little to no muscle tone despite their strength. A large part of their body mass is located in the abdominal area, thus making it very difficult to for an endomorph to acquire a 6-pack. Endomorphs generally have a small stature with short arms and legs that give them a stalky appearance. They are also the somatotype with the highest risk of obesity because they have a very slow metabolism. In turn, they are prone to a large number of health problems if their body fat is not kept in check. Usually, endomorphs are social, fun-loving, and naturally relaxed. They are the hardest somatotype to have if one desires to become a bodybuilder. The best dieting approach for an endomorph would consist of low-carbohydrates to avoid gaining more fat and large protein intake to aid in muscle building. The ideal fitness routine for an endomorph would consist of large amounts of cardio as well as high reps with little rest between sets to keep heart-rate high. Endomorphs have the most difficult time with motivation in the sense that it is much more difficult to make one's self do large amounts of cardio than it is to simply lift weights.</p>
