		<p>If there are any among you that have hit a snag in your training and have nowhere to turn, fear not because many are in the same boat. Let me guess, you're in the gym for 2 hours a day, 6 days a week, working yourself until you drop and for some unexplained reason you can't manage to get hardly, if any, gains. Well, believe it or not there is an answer. Chances are, you have no idea about your body type and needs.</p>
		<div><strong>Body type plays a huge role in how you respond to diet and training. Understanding what type you are is important!</strong></div>
		<p> Is it hard for you to gain weight? Lose fat? Do both of these come easy to you? Knowing the requirements based on your body is the fundamental building block for your training, without that knowledge you're gambling away your precious time. The only thing worse than getting no results is getting no results after training your hardest. That's why you shouldn't just work hard, but know how to work hard based on what your body needs, and that's where body types come in.

			<h3> My Bodybuilding History</h3>
			<p>I've been into bodybuilding for 5 years. Only within the last two have I both taken it seriously and become a personal trainer. My oldest brother got me into bodybuilding in the first place. He has been a trainer for 20+ years and was the runner-up in the 2009 Mr. Indiana competition. I have extensive knowledge in lifting techniques and nutrition, as well as multiple clients that have reached great achievements in their journey of transforming their body.</p>
