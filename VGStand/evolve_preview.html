            <h1>Evolve Preview</h1>
            <h2>"The hunt is on, the Big Alpha impresses"</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Evolve&#39;s Big Alpha recently ran on multiple consoles and I had the chance to get a little hands on time with it. Coming from the same devloper as the highly loved Left 4 Dead series, I came in expecting quite a bit and my faith was well placed. Although only in the beginning stages considering it was a Big Alpha and not even the Beta stage of development, it was incredibly well crafted.</p>
                <p>So starting out, the menu gives players a number of options to choose their game and matchmaking preferences. The classes are broken down from Medic, Support, Trapper, Assault, and Monster and players can choose an order from most preferred to least to ensure that they are able to play as the classes that they enjoy rather than get stuck in a role they have little to no interest or enjoyment from.</p>
<p>
I started out with the Assault class, which the main role is what it sounds like, they focus on taking out the Monster while others do their parts. The default Assault class is given a Lightning Gun, Assault Rifle, Arc Mines, and Personal Shield. The Lightning Gun is the big hitter of the arsenal and is what I spent most of my time using, however, the Arc Mines are the second most effective choice while waiting for the Lightning Gun&#39;s cooldown. The Assault Rifle is also a good choice, but it does comparable damage to the Arc Mine, but is a less tactical tool. The Personal Shield is the perfect tool to use once you&#39;ve baited the Monster into a committed assault against you. When your health drops to a low level, utilize the Personal Shield while the Medic heals you and go right back on the Assault.</p>
                <img src="images/evolve_article_image_1.jpg" />
                <label>The Lightning Gun really packs a punch and from what I see, Assault&#39;s best method of taking down a Monster.</label>
                <p>The other Hunter Class I got some hands on time with was the Support class, whose default loadout is the Laser Cutter, Shield Projector, Orbital Barrage, and Cloak. Every ability of the Support class is a valuable asset to the team. The Laser Cutter is definitely the weakest part of the arsenal here, but the Orbital Barrage makes up for that in a big way. I was able to take a large chunk of health away from Monsters when they were slowed by a Tranquilizer from a Medic and slowed into place, perfect for the Orbital Barrage. The Shield Projector functions much like the Medicâ€™s Healing Gun, except that it continously helps generate other Hunter&#39;s shields. The Cloak is perfect for when you and other hunters are backed into a corner by the Monster. It cloaks the user and all teammates within its radius which aids in a speedy retreat to recover. </p>
                <p>I spent most of my time playing the Hunter classes, but I did make a bit for the Monster class too. I only got the chance to play as the Goliath, seeing as the Kraken needed to be unlocked through more play. The Monster has a little more customization to it than the Hunters do by default. The Monster player has the choice of 4 abilities from the list of Boulder Toss, Lurk, Fire Breath, Shred, Leap Smash, Ground Pound, and Track Prey. Personally, I stuck with Fire Breath, Boulder Toss, Leap Smash, and Track Prey. I&#39;ll admit, I wasn&#39;t the best playing as the Monster, but even so, it was incredible. The gameplay is balanced well enough that even when facing 4 Hunters, you&#39;ve got a fair chance.</p>

                <label>THIS guy will be the bane of your existence. Expect an intense hunt to take him down, including frustration.</label>
                <p>So overall, Evolve looks promising, and I&#39;m itching to play more. The classes all serve their purpose exaclty and it takes teamwork to really nail down the process of hunting down and slaying Monster&#39;s in each round. Each character skin in game also gives players a completely new arsenal to work with for the hunt and provides enough variation to keep the game fresh and compelling. The hunt is on, the Big Alpha impresses.</p>
